This repository contains the supporting Python notebooks and pdf submission for the 2019 NFL Punt Analytics Competition. The notebooks used a combination of pandas, seaborn, and bokeh to manipulate the data and present visualizations supporting our argument.

More details on the submission can be found in the pdf in the repository.

Please note: commits to this repo were limited because the majority of the work was done inside the Kaggle Kernel. Given the opportunity in the future, I would create a separate development environment and uploaded only the result as a Kernel.
